# Anugamana (The Path)

**Anugamana** is an AI-powered spiritual companion designed to bridge the gap between modern emotional dilemmas and ancient wisdom. 

Unlike traditional keyword searches, Anugamana uses **Semantic Search** and **Vector Embeddings**. This allows users to input their state of mind in natural language (e.g., *"I feel overwhelmed by pressure"*), and the system retrieves the most relevant verses from the **Bhagavad Gita**.

## 🚀 Features

- **Semantic Search:** Understands the *meaning* behind queries, not just keywords.
- **Vector Database:** Uses ChromaDB to store and retrieve high-dimensional text embeddings.
- **FastAPI Backend:** A lightweight, high-performance API serving the data.
- **Data Source:** Scraped from Vedabase (Chapters 1-18).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.11+
- **Framework:** FastAPI
- **AI/NLP:** Sentence-Transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
- **Database:** ChromaDB
- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind CSS (In Progress)
